### Meny v2

This repository contains the code for Meny, a recipe sharing web application.

It is a rewrite of the original Meny, with more complete features and different technologies that I want to experiment a bit more with.

This is a work in progress and for now the application is not yet functional, only parts of the API are currently exposed.

### Technologies

Backend: Node.js, Nestjs, Postgres
Frontend: TBD, probably React with Next
